In this directory I implement a leptonic model based on Finke (2016). This paper
develops simplified expressions for external Compton scattering on arbitrary
external radiation fields.

As a future step, I will develop similar expressions for photohadronic
interactions with arbitrary radiation fields and the corresponding cascading
expressions.
