In this directory I implement a leptonic model based on Finke (2016). This paper
develops simplified expressions for external Compton scattering on arbitrary
external radiation fields.

The external libraries quadpack.f90 and zeroin.f are taken from
https://people.math.sc.edu/Burkardt/f_src/quadpack/quadpack.f90
and
http://www.netlib.org/fmm/zeroin.f
respectively.
